          I'm a developer with experience in Angular, React, TypeScript, .NET
          Core/ASP.NET, and SQL Server (T-SQL).

        <p>
          My knowledge of Angular, TypeScript, .NET Core/ASP.NET, and SQL Server
          (T-SQL) is applied in my work, while I have hands-on experience with
          React and JavaScript in personal projects.
        </p>

          Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development
          at the Federal Institute of SÃ£o Paulo.

        <p>
          Driven by challenges, I am always looking for opportunities to grow my
          skills and make meaningful contributions to the projects I work on.
